## CS 625 - Data Visualization Semester Project  
In this project, I was tasked with utilizing data journalism and storytelling techniques to implement an explanatory visualization that revealed something interesting. I chose to investigate the phenomenon of so-called car bloat.  
The report and final visualization can be found [here](https://github.com/calebkbrad/car-bloat-visualization)  
## CS 725 - Information Visualization Semester Project  
In this project, I was tasked with employing effective dashboard design techniques to implement a dashboard with meaningful user interactions. I chose to continue investigating vehicle weight trends as I did in CS 625.  
The report and final dashboard can be found [here](https://github.com/calebkbrad/725Project/blob/main/project-report.md)  
## CS 620 - Intro to Data Science Semester Project  
In this project, I employed Python libraries to investigate global energy trends with a focus on renewable vs nonrenewable energy usage.  
The Google Colab notebook with all work done for the project can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13aEsPHRwSAUX9BxaG5beelY-hLmBAmMe?usp=sharing)
