I am an undergraduate student currently studying Computer Science at Old Dominion University. I transferred to ODU after earning my Associate's at Tidewater Community College with the support of the TCC Women's Center Stem Promise Program Scholarship. I currently plan on pursuing my Master's in Computer Science after graduation through ODU's Linked BSCS/MS in Computer Science Program. I am currently participating in the Undergraduate Research Experience in Disinformation Detection and Analysis at ODU, specifically working with Dr. Michael Nelson on his "Did they Really Tweet That?" project.
