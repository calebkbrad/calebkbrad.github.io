I am an undergraduate student currently studying Computer Science at Old Dominion University. I transferred to ODU after earning my Associate's at Tidewater Community College with the support of the TCC Women's Center Stem Promise Program Scholarship. I currently plan on pursuing my Master's in Computer Science after graduation through ODU's Linked BSCS/MS in Computer Science Program.
