I am a graduate student currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Old Dominion University. I earned my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from ODU in the summer of 2023 through the Linked BSCS/MS program. I transferred to ODU after earning my Associate's at Tidewater Community College with the support of the TCC Women's Center Stem Promise Program Scholarship. I was a member of the 2022 cohort of the Research Experience for Undergraduates in Disinformation Detection and Analysis at ODU. I specifically worked with Dr. Michael Nelson on his "Did they Really Tweet That?" project. I am currently a graduate teaching assistant for CS 151 - Intro to Programming with Java 1. I am also currently working on a tool in relation to the "Did they Really Tweet That?" project.  

## Coding Projects  
Below are some of my coding projects, some related to coursework, others related to research.  

### A Universal Web Scraper for Archived Twitter URIs (in-progress)  
In this project, I am developing a command line tool to take an archived Twitter URI (either a status page or profile page) and scrape useful information about the archived resource, regardless of UI Twitter was using at the time of archival. The code and instructions for use are located [here](https://github.com/calebkbrad/tweet-memento-scraper)  

### CS 734 - Intro to Information Retrieval Semester Project  
In this project, I developed and locally deployed a vector-based seearch engine for a dataset of over 250,000 images of scientific figures. This search engine utilizes the OpenAI CLIP model to generate vector embeddings to support both text-to-image and image-to-image search simultaneously. The search engine also utilized a locally employed Elastic Search Docker container to store the embeddings and handle queries. The code and associated report can be found [here](https://github.com/calebkbrad/Vector-Search-Engine)  

### CS 531 - Web Server Design Semester Project  
In this project, I developed an HTTP compliant web server from scratch and locally deployed the server using Docker. This was developed over the course of 5 assignments, each building off of each other and focusing on different HTTP server functionalities and status codes. The code and other related resources can be found [here](https://github.com/calebkbrad/calebsserver)

## Data Projects  
Below are my course projects related to data science and analytics.
### CS 625 - Data Visualization Semester Project  
In this project, I was tasked with utilizing data journalism and storytelling techniques to implement an explanatory visualization that revealed something interesting. I chose to investigate the phenomenon of so-called car bloat.  
The report and final visualization can be found [here](https://github.com/calebkbrad/car-bloat-visualization)  
### CS 725 - Information Visualization Semester Project  
In this project, I was tasked with employing effective dashboard design techniques to implement a dashboard with meaningful user interactions. I chose to continue investigating vehicle weight trends, continuing the analysis that I started in CS 625.  
The report and final dashboard can be found [here](https://github.com/calebkbrad/725Project/blob/main/project-report.md)  
### CS 620 - Intro to Data Science Semester Project  
In this project, I employed Python libraries to investigate global energy trends with a focus on renewable vs nonrenewable energy usage.  
The Google Colab notebook with all work done for the project can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13aEsPHRwSAUX9BxaG5beelY-hLmBAmMe?usp=sharing)
