I am a graduate student currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Old Dominion University. I earned my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from ODU in the summer of 2023 through the Linked BSCS/MS program. I transferred to ODU after earning my Associate's at Tidewater Community College with the support of the TCC Women's Center Stem Promise Program Scholarship. I was a member of the 2022 cohort of the Research Experience for Undergraduates in Disinformation Detection and Analysis at ODU. I specifically worked with Dr. Michael Nelson on his "Did they Really Tweet That?" project.
